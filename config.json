In the viewing mode, players can click on buildings to view their overall appearance, use two fingers to rotate or zoom in to see building details, and click the \"Details\" button to view specific information about the buildings, including real-world images and historical background. In the game mode, players take on the role of a new UESTC student and allocate their time to choose courses, clubs, life, competitions, emotions, and research events, aiming to prepare for their future and manage their time efficiently. After four years, players receive a graduation report that reveals the kind of talent they have become, with hundreds of achievements waiting to be unlocked."

In terms of programming, I implemented all the software features, including subsequent updates to Meta-UESTC 2.0, maintenance of the Android download platform website, and more. In art-related tasks, I handled all animation production and shader creation."

This included creating Gantt charts for resource allocation in game development, verifying the reasonableness of game data by filling in thousands of data sheets and using MATLAB for data calculation, expanding and optimizing game-related functions based on user feedback from trial players, and writing in-game content. For programming, I learned the concept of extensible frameworks, especially in the context of long-term project code maintenance and optimization. Specifically, I learned AR/VR program development, batch data processing tool creation, and various core systems and optimization algorithms. In terms of art, I learned how to create effects through programming, including creating shaders through code and connections. Animation effects were also essential, and I learned general animation design by continuously adjusting and designing animation curves. In terms of marketing and management, I learned how to operate and sell the game and physical products, including media promotion, advertisement creation, and post-promotion."
