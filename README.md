# 2024 Duke GDDI Portfolio Template

## Overview

Welcome to the 2024 Duke GDDI Portfolio Template! This repository provides a simple, configurable, and professional portfolio template for students. The template is built as a static site and uses GitHub Pages—a free, easy-to-set-up hosting solution—making it ideal for engineers and developers to showcase their work.

### Why Use GitHub Pages?

- **Free Hosting**: No cost for hosting your site.
- **Easy to Deploy**: Simply push your code to the repository, and your site will be live.
- **Professional Presence**: GitHub Pages is a trusted hosting option widely used by engineers and developers.
- **Version Control**: Built-in version control with GitHub makes tracking changes and collaboration seamless.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file of the website. **Tip**: You only need to change the `<title>` tag for custom page titles.
- `config.json` - The primary configuration file for customizing content.
- `assets/` - Built-in assets for the site (icons, etc.). **Do not modify** unless you have a specific need to change built-in assets.
- `projects/` - Folder to store project-related images, videos, and other files.
- `photo.jpg` - Your profile picture (replace with your own).
- `RESUME_JAMESYONG_2024_DUKE_GDDI.pdf` - Placeholder for your resume (replace with your own).
- Various favicon and web manifest files for compatibility.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

To correctly deploy your site using GitHub Pages, **create a repository with the name `yourusername.github.io`** (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username).

#### 2. Add Projects

Each project should have the following structure in the `projects` array:

```json

  ],
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "value": "Detailed description."
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "value": "/projects/project-folder/image.jpg"
    },
    {
      "type": "video-muted",
      "value": "/projects/project-folder/video.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Additional Notes
